# Solution 1: Repeated DNA Sequences
Let's solve the Repeated DNA Sequences problem using the Sliding Window pattern.

## Statement
A DNA sequence consists of nucleotides represented by the letters ‘A’, ‘C’, ‘G’, and ‘T’ only. For example, “ACGAATTCCG” is a valid DNA sequence.

Given a string, s, that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (continuous substrings of exactly 10 characters) that appear more than once in s. You can return the output in any order.
# Solution 2: Sliding Window Maximum

Solve the Sliding Window Maximum problem using the Sliding Window pattern.

## Statement

Given an integer array nums and an integer window size w, return an array of the maximum values in all the contiguous subarrays (windows) of size w.
# Solution 3: Minimum Window Subsequence
Solve the Minimum Window Subsequence problem using the Sliding Window pattern.

## Statement
Given two strings, str1 and str2, find the shortest substring in str1 such that str2 is a subsequence of that substring.

A substring is defined as a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

# Solution 4: Minimum Window Substring
Let's solve the Minimum Window Substring problem using the Sliding Window pattern.

## Statement
Given two strings, s and t, find the minimum window substring in s, which has the following properties:

It is the shortest substring of s that includes all of the characters present in t.

It must contain at least the same frequency of each character as in t.

The order of the characters does not matter here.

# Solution 5: Longest Repeating Character Replacement
Let's solve the Longest Repeating Character Replacement problem using the Sliding Window pattern.

## Statement
Given a string s and an integer k, find the length of the longest substring in s, where all characters are identical, after replacing, at most, k characters with any other lowercase English character.
