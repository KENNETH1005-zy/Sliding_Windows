# Solution: Repeated DNA Sequences
Let's solve the Repeated DNA Sequences problem using the Sliding Window pattern.

## Statement
A DNA sequence consists of nucleotides represented by the letters ‘A’, ‘C’, ‘G’, and ‘T’ only. For example, “ACGAATTCCG” is a valid DNA sequence.

Given a string, s, that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (continuous substrings of exactly 10 characters) that appear more than once in s. You can return the output in any order.
# Solution: Sliding Window Maximum

Solve the Sliding Window Maximum problem using the Sliding Window pattern.

## Statement

Given an integer array nums and an integer window size w, return an array of the maximum values in all the contiguous subarrays (windows) of size w.
# Solution: Minimum Window Subsequence
Solve the Minimum Window Subsequence problem using the Sliding Window pattern.

## Statement
Given two strings, str1 and str2, find the shortest substring in str1 such that str2 is a subsequence of that substring.

A substring is defined as a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
